<!--<p>The International Conference on Expert Applications & Security (ICITDA 2018) is the premier conference for the presentation of new advances and research results in the fields of Computer Science Engineering Applications and Security, to be held in the lovely and highly vibrant city of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India. </p>
<p>ICITDA  2018 aims to provide an opportunistic forum and vibrant platform for researchers and industry practitioners to exchange state-of-the-art knowledge gained from their original research work and practical developments on specific new challenges, applications and experiences, to establish business or research relations, and to find global partners for future collaboration on emerging issues.
</p>
<p>The Expert Application concept of the conference will focus on current advances in research and use of Expert Systems with particular focus on the role in maintaining academic level while sharing novel research and cutting-edge developments in the fields of Computer System Security using cryptographic algorithms and other security schemes for system as well as for cloud.
<p>Original unpublished manuscripts, and not currently under review in another journal or conference, are solicited in relevant areas. For more details, Please visit Conference webpage <a href="www.ICITDA .in">www.ICITDA .in</a>.</p>
<p><b><u>Venue:</u></b> Jaipur Engineering College & Research Centre, Jaipur</p>
<p><b><u>Dates of Conference:</u></b> February 17-18, 2018</p>
<p><b><u>Submission Guidelines:</u></b><br/>
We are pleased to invite you to submit original contributions to ICITDA 2018 via the official submission system for the conference https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ICITDA 2018. This can include, technical and experimental, theoretical, conceptual, or a survey in the form of Position Paper/ Fast Abstracts/ Poster Papers/Tool Demonstrations/ Industrial Contributions.<br/>
Articles submitted to the conference should report original, previously unpublished research results, experimental or theoretical offering novel research contributions in any aspect of Expert Applications & Security and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Submissions will be double blind peer reviewed and evaluated based on originality, technical and/ or research content/depth, correctness, relevance to conference, contributions, and readability. The full paper submissions will be chosen based on technical merit, interest, applicability and how well they fit a coherent and balanced technical program.<br/>
Topics of interests should fall under one or more of the conference tracks:<br/><br/></p>-->

<p style="text-align: justify;">Prospective authors are invited to submit papers of four (4) to eight (8) A4 pages (including tables, figures and references) in standard format (it is absolutely necessary to respect the Styleguide for Papers). A blind peer-review process will be used to evaluate all submitted papers. Each full registration for the conference will cover a maximum of one paper; each student registration will cover a single paper only. Extra paper, 2nd paper and onwards, must be registered separately. The format instructions in the template must be followed, it is notably important to use the right paper format: A4 to have the right margins not to use page numbering (page footer must be empty).
